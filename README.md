# JavaScriptBackEnd
Experimenting with more backend scenarios - SSO, separate out API, CORS, LoopBack

# Installation

- write me!!

# Car store TODO
 - check origin on server for api authorization ?
 - use PKI rather than shared secret
 - handle expiration - renew and too late
 - common code between servers?

# Candy Store TODO

## client
 - test more - history seems limited?? Something to do with readding the ember app?
 
 - wrap file in immediate and share functions to jquery  X
 - get jwt from carstore
 - verify candy store independently - maneagable not managed...

## server
 - add jwt check to candy server

## overall
 - split candy into api server and web server and maybe authorization server behind nginx or kong
